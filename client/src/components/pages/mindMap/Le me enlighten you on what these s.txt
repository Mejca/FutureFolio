Le me enlighten you on what these sections provide:
starting from the top right and working my way clockwise
auto -arrange
choose style (color of branch and node)
delete branch
copy branch
drag to transplant branch
add branch (adds a nod with a branch from the node that you have clicked)
Choose shape (of node)

when you click the node it initiates an animation where a small box gets create
as you can tell bottom left of the box has an extendable corner to adjust size
other buttons on the top of this box are: font, link a website, upload an image, upload a file, and add an icon
some of the buttons then lead to min menus within this small navbar within the text box of the node

if the cursor hovers at some set distance from any node (lets say 5 times it's height) a + button appears at one of the 4 addable branch areas are on the rectangular node



would you add anything that needs to be implemented if:
I want a specific shapes available and buttons that have to appear at certain times when the cursor passes by at the right distance. Also being able to add files/photos/links to the mindmap nodes

These additions to our checklist cover the specific features you've requested, including the circular context menu, proximity-based button display, specific node shapes, media attachments, and enhanced branch operations. They also address potential performance, accessibility, and error handling considerations for these new features.
This comprehensive checklist covers the major aspects of creating a robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich mind map component. It addresses core functionality, user interface design, data management, performance optimization, accessibility, advanced features, styling, testing, documentation, error handling, performance monitoring, and even collaboration features if needed.

As you work through this checklist, you'll be able to systematically build and refine your mind map component, ensuring that no critical details are overlooked in the process. Remember to prioritize these tasks based on your specific needs and the project's timeline.

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this checklist, or do you need any clarification on any of the points?
